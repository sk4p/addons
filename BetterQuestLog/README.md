A Minimalist Quest Log Replacement for Wildstar

Hello to anyone reading this! If you're looking to contribute to the project or are just interested in something that this project does I encourage you to dive right in. If you need any assistance my email is buddyp450@gmail.com.

Broadly speaking, this quest log was aimed to be more familiar to MMO players such as myself who entered into MMO gaming in the early WoW days. My goal was to eliminate any inconvenience associated with navigating the quest log. In my opinion, the quest log should serve as just that - a log. It should not be something that you have to endlessly navigate to and fro to accomplish what needs to be accomplished.

That said, a quest log serves a few key purposes:
1) Re-reading quests that you're interested in
2) Showing what quests (and later quest-stage) that your group members are currently on
3) Selecting quests to track
4) Misc. admin functions such as abandoning quests

I don't expect to use the quest log to figure out what I have to do or where to go. Quest Tracker serves that purpose.

All in all I hope to abide by this vision and continue to iterate and improve upon the quest log so that it is as seamlessly integrated with the questing experience as possible.

If you have any suggestions or would like to contribute please drop me a line.

Thanks!
